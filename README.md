### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Fusion Energy Engineer 

- Predominantly work on the modelling for fusion reactor design:
    - Neutronics
    - CFD / MHD
    - Structural Analysis
    - Thermal Hydraulics

- Recently completed a PhD in Nuclear Physics, researching the measurement and modelling of nuclear reaction cross-sections:
    - Nuclear reaction cross-sections 
    - Nuclear data 
    - Isotope production 
    - Transmutation
 
Interested in developing and leveraging open-source software to enable the commercialisation of clean technology such as fusion. 
   
- ðŸ”­ I develop scripts and tool to assist with reactor design 
- As my skills grow I aim to contribute to open-source development
