### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Fusion Energy Engineer** with a specialisation in designing, simulating and optimising fusion reactor systems. My work encompasses areas such as **Neutronics**, **Computational Fluid Dynamics/Magnetohydrodynamics (CFD/MHD)**, **Structural Analysis**, and **Thermal Hydraulics**.

I hold a **PhD in Nuclear Physics**, where I delved into nuclear reaction measurements and modeling, focusing on reaction cross-sections, nuclear data, isotope production, and transmutation.

Currently, I'm developing scripts and tools to enhance reactor design and extend my involvement in open-source projects that support the commercialization of clean technologies like fusion energy.
